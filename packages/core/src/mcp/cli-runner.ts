/**
 * Shared helpers for the codex/gemini MCP servers' subprocess invocations.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *   1. Retry-once on transient subprocess failure (configurable via
 *      CRITIQUE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS / CRITIQUE_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS in config). The
 *      retry is suppressed when stderr matches a "persistent" pattern (model
 *      not found, auth, ENOENT, command-line-too-long) — retrying those just
 *      wastes time.
 *   2. Archive failure context to <cwd>/.harness/critique_failures/ so users
 *      and the judge sub-agent have post-hoc evidence. The path is returned in
 *      the result envelope as `failure_archive_path`.
 *
 * The judge sub-agents receive `exit_code`, `attempts[]`, and
 * `failure_archive_path` in the bridge response and use them to decide whether
 * to retry at the agent layer or surface `judge_tool_failed=true` to the
 * driver. This is defense-in-depth: server retries handle transient infra
 * blips silently; agent halts on truly broken environments.
 *
 * PP-RS-3 (issue 1 + 2): This module maintains a process-wide registry of
 * in-flight child processes and exports:
 *   - trackedExeca()              — drop-in execa wrapper that auto-registers /
 *                                   deregisters; all MCP-path spawns use this.
 *                                   Throws SpawnRefusedError once shutdown begins.
 *   - trackedExecaNoRefuse()      — teardown-safe variant: skips the
 *                                   _spawnRefused guard so worktree cleanup can
 *                                   proceed during shutdown, but still registers
 *                                   the child in ACTIVE_CHILDREN.  Throws
 *                                   SpawnRefusedError once _sealTeardown() is
 *                                   called (the final drain phase).
 *   - abortAllInFlightChildren()  — dynamic drain loop: SIGTERM→SIGKILL each
 *                                   batch, re-snapshot after each pass until
 *                                   empty (catches teardown children spawned
 *                                   mid-drain), then seals teardown so no new
 *                                   children can join after the final pass.
 *                                   While a critical op is in flight the drain
 *                                   uses ABORT_CRITICAL_GRACE_MS (default 10 s)
 *                                   instead of ABORT_GRACEFUL_MS (2 s) before
 *                                   escalating to SIGKILL, allowing small merges
 *                                   to complete atomically.  SIGKILL is always
 *                                   the final backstop.
 *   - enterCriticalOp() /         — bracket a project-root write (git merge /
 *     exitCriticalOp()              cpSync).  The drain loop reads the counter
 *                                   to decide which grace cap to use.
 *   - SpawnRefusedError           — typed sentinel for "daemon shutting down";
 *                                   callers MUST rethrow this before any
 *                                   destructive fallback.
 *   - _activeChildrenSize()       — test-only size accessor.

/**
 * Run the sub-CLI with one server-side retry on transient failure. Each
 * attempt's outcome is captured into `attempts[]`. Persistent failures (per
 * `isPersistentStderr`) skip the retry to avoid wasting wall-clock.
 *
 * On final non-zero exit, archives the failure context to
 * <cwd>/.harness/critique_failures/<vendor>_<unix_ms>.txt and returns the
 * path in `failure_archive_path` so callers can include it in their response.
 *
 * Note: this function does not interpret stdout. Callers do their own parsing
 * (Codex JSONL, Gemini text/JSON) on the returned stdout.

# Stakeholder Communications

Used by `chief-communications-officer`, `ceo`, `cfo`, `clo`, and any executive composing audience-facing communications. The skill operationalizes the discipline that one narrative is told consistently across audiences with audience-appropriate emphasis.

## Mendelow Power / Interest Grid

Map every material stakeholder onto a 2×2:

| | Low Interest | High Interest |
|---|---|---|
| **High Power** | Keep Satisfied — concise, periodic | Manage Closely — bespoke, frequent |
| **Low Power** | Monitor — broadcast | Keep Informed — accessible, transparent |

Mapped by name for: board members, top 20 investors (institutional + strategic), top 50 customers, employees (by segment), regulators (by jurisdiction), key media, industry analysts, civil society, employees' families (during crisis).

## Audience-Specific Message Frameworks

### Board
- What decision is requested or what update is being given (lead with the ask)
- Material risks acknowledged honestly
- Financial impact quantified
- Management recommendation (single recommendation; alternatives in appendix)
- What we need from the board (decision, advice, or just visibility)

### Investors (institutional / retail)
- Narrative arc: where we were → what we saw → what we're doing → why now → success criteria → ask
- Quantification: every claim tied to a forecast metric
- Risks acknowledged transparently
- Capital allocation framework reiterated
- Avoid: surprises, retreats from prior commitments without explanation, jargon

### Employees
- Honest acknowledgment of the situation
- Impact on them, specifically
- What's being asked of them (or not asked)
- What support is available
- What we will tell them, by when, going forward
- Avoid: spin, vague reassurance, top-down monologue without listening channel

### Customers
- Their outcome first (what their experience will be)
- What we are doing
- What they need to do (if anything)
- Where to get more info / help
- Commitment to follow-up

### Regulators
- Facts only (no narrative pull)
- Material change in operations, exposure, or risk
- Compliance actions taken
- Reporting cadence going forward
- Privileged matters handled per `clo`

### Media
- Single source-of-truth message
- Spokesperson designated; others "all media inquiries to X"
- Avoid: speculation, off-the-record drift, anonymous quote risk

## Executive Memo Style Guide

- One page max for an executive memo (longer than that — write a brief + appendices)
- Lead with the decision / ask / recommendation
- Active voice; short sentences
- Quantify; "many" / "soon" / "significant" are red flags
- Always include: what changed, why now, what we're doing, what we ask of you
- No jargon for cross-functional audiences
- Risk acknowledged in proportion (not hidden; not over-weighted)

## Board Deck Structure (10–12 slides canonical)

1. **Title / agenda** — what's being decided / discussed
2. **Executive summary** — one slide; recommendation + confidence + ask
3. **Situation** — what changed; what we know
4. **Strategic context** — how this fits the thesis
5. **Options considered** — A / B / C with decision-framework scoring
6. **Financial analysis** — base / upside / downside; key sensitivities
7. **Risk & mitigation** — material risks; mitigation plan
8. **Execution plan** — phases, owners, milestones, success criteria
9. **Stakeholder impact** — customers, employees, investors, regulators
10. **Recommendation** — clear ask; what we need from the board
11. **Open questions** — unresolved
12. **Appendix references** — detailed analysis, dissenting views, raw data

## Investor Narrative Arc

```
1. Where we were
   (Honest baseline; what wasn't working / what changed)

2. What we saw
   (The insight or external shift that motivated action)

3. What we're doing
   (Concrete actions; phases; owners)

4. Why now
   (Urgency; window of opportunity or risk-mitigation timing)

5. Success criteria
   (Measurable outcomes; cadence of reporting against them)

6. The ask
   (Investor-specific call to action: support, capital, patience, vote)
```

## All-Hands Template

```
# All-Hands — [Date]

## What's new since last all-hands
[3–5 concrete items]

## Where we stand vs plan
[Key metrics; honest performance]

## What we're focused on this quarter
[3 priorities, no more]

## What changed (if anything significant)
[Honest acknowledgment; what it means]

## What we need from you
[Specific asks]

## Q&A
[Live; logged; follow-ups committed]
```

## Regulatory Submission Cover Letter

- Formal address; case / matter number
- Statement of compliance with the request (or proposed alternative)
- Index of enclosed materials
- Privileged-document log (with `clo`)
- Point-of-contact (single)
- Closing reaffirmation of cooperation

## Crisis Holding Statement (see also `crisis-response`)

Within 60 min of SEV-1 declaration:

```
[Timestamp]
We are aware of [event].
Our priority is [primary affected].
We have: [actions].
Next update by [time].
[Channel].
[Named executive] leads.
```

## Dissent-Protocol Communication

When a recommended decision overrides an executive's dissenting opinion:

```
### Dissent recorded — [role-slug]

- Position: [Their position, 1 sentence]
- Reasoning: [3-5 bullets, verbatim]
- Specific risk if majority recommendation taken: [What they think breaks]
- Conditions to revisit: [Evidence / events]
```

Preserved verbatim in minutes; never paraphrased. This mitigates the groupthink failure mode the research doc explicitly cites as a multi-agent risk.

## One Narrative, Multiple Audiences

The same facts → audience-appropriate emphasis, not different stories. Inconsistency across audiences destroys trust faster than uncomfortable specifics. The `chief-communications-officer` owns the through-line.

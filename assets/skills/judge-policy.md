# Judge policy (tiered + content-aware + profile-aware)

The driver MUST call `gate_eligible_judges` before invoking any judge. This document is the human-readable summary; the decision the driver applies comes from the daemon, not from this file.

## Base tier (per `gate_type`)

| `gate_type` | Cross-vendor required? |
|---|---|
| `spec` | YES |
| `design` | YES |
| `security` | YES |
| `contract` | YES |
| `code_style` | NO (same-vendor OK only when the chosen vendor can honor the model invariant) |
| `docs_polish` | NO |
| `lint_class` | NO |

## Content-aware upgrades

Even when the base tier is "same-vendor OK", the daemon scans the prompt keywords for a regex set covering security, concurrency, data integrity, authentication, and migration vocabulary. A match upgrades the gate to **cross-vendor required**, regardless of base tier. The decision returned by `gate_eligible_judges` carries `upgraded: true` and a `reason` string.

Keyword groups that trigger upgrade:
- security: `security`, `threat`, `owasp`, `cve`, `rbac`, `crypto`, `privacy`, `gdpr`, `sbom`, `injection`, `xss`, `csrf`, `sqli`, `hipaa`, `pci`, `pii`, `phi`, `sox`, `password`, `credential`, `oauth`, `openid`, `saml`, `jwt`, `sso`, `auth`
- concurrency / data-integrity: `concurren*`, `thread`, `race`, `deadlock`, `atomic`, `mutex`, `lock`, `migration*`, `schema`, `rollback`

## Profile-aware upgrades

- `enterprise` profile → cross-vendor on **every** gate (no same-vendor escape).
- `ai-agentic` profile → cross-vendor on any gate touching evals or tool permissions (regex on `eval`, `tool_permission`, `hitl`).

Other profiles do not change tier directly; they bind specific rubrics (e.g. `web-ui` → WCAG on design gates).

## Vendor matrix

If the harness has only one configured vendor (`doctor` returns `cross_vendor_ready: false`), every cross-vendor gate REFUSES to run. The driver must STOP, surface a clear error, and ask the user to configure the missing vendor (set `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `GEMINI_API_KEY` or run `codex login` / `gemini auth`).

The daemon will not silently downgrade a security/spec/design/contract gate to same-vendor.

### Gemini disabled (`PP_DISABLE_GEMINI=1`)

When the global Gemini kill-switch is set, `doctor()` reports `vendors_configured.google=false` and `gemini_disabled=true`, and `gate_eligible_judges` drops Gemini from `allowed_judges[].preferred_producers`. Cross-vendor judging therefore routes to **Codex only** (the default pair is Codex + Claude, so cross-vendor gates still run), and the degenerate same-vendor Gemini lane is unavailable. The `preferred_producers` list returned by `gate_eligible_judges` is **authoritative** — it overrides any team yaml `model_pref: gemini` hint when Gemini is disabled. Re-enable by unsetting the flag (and re-authenticating the Gemini CLI).

## De-biasing in best-of-N

When `N ≥ 3`, the daemon randomizes the candidate order before sending them to the judge (Fisher-Yates with a seeded RNG; the seed is recorded for replay). The judge produces a ranking; the daemon runs **Borda count** to pick the winner. This mitigates position bias.

For best-of-2, the driver should ask the judge for a structured rubric score per candidate first, THEN ask for a pick — never the other way around — to mitigate verbosity bias.

## Self-bias

- **Codex:** `pp_codex.critique` is hard-pinned to `gpt-5.4`. Same-vendor Codex judging is therefore only legal when the generator used a different model id. If the generator already used `gpt-5.4`, `gate_eligible_judges` upgrades the gate to cross-vendor.
- **Gemini:** `pp_gemini.critique` is hard-pinned to `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. Same-vendor Gemini judging is a documented degenerate case (same model on both sides) until a second supported 3.x critique model ships.
- **Claude:** same-vendor Claude judging still requires a different model id from the generator.

## Fable-5 tier (capability-gated)

`fable` (`claude-fable-5`) is a dedicated tier for problems that exceed opus-class
reasoning. It is **NOT** in the `TIER_ORDER` ladder and is **NEVER** reached by
automatic `shiftTier` escalation (`shiftTier("opus", +1)` clamps at opus).

Fable is selected only via explicit operator config (there is NO `--tier fable` CLI flag, and fable is NEVER reached by automatic shiftTier ladder escalation):
1. **deep-reasoning-team** — `deep-reasoning-team.yaml` sets `generator.model_tier: fable` on every stage. Invoke by running a team-mode request against `deep-reasoning-team` (the team name is the filename stem).
2. **Team yaml per-stage override** — any team yaml (builtin, project-local, or user-global) can set `generator.model_tier: fable` on a specific stage.
3. **Profile per-stage override** — a profile's `model_tier_policy.per_stage_override[<stage.kind>]: fable` selects fable for that stage kind. This is explicit operator-authored profile config, not auto-escalation.

The `--tier-cap` and `--tier-floor` CLI flags are explicitly skipped for off-ladder tiers (off-ladder guard: `tierIndex(initial_tier) >= 0` is required before applying any cap or floor comparison). An explicit fable selection set via team yaml is therefore never clamped down to opus/sonnet/haiku by a CLI flag.

Because fable is off the ladder, the `shiftTier` defensive guard returns the tier
unchanged for `shiftTier("fable", ±N)`. Ordinary haiku→sonnet→opus ladder escalation
can never reach fable.

Judge contract for Fable-generated stages: the judge MUST be cross-vendor (Codex or
Gemini). The same-vendor same-model guard at `runs.ts:641` already blocks fable-judges-fable,
but the team yaml must not even request it.

Pricing: conservative placeholder at 2× opus rates. Confirm with Anthropic before
production budget projections.

## Escalated judging (opt-in)

The judge MAY set `escalate: true` on `pp_codex.critique` for sanctioned hard gates only:

- **Major-scope security or architecture gates** — e.g. OWASP/ASVS-L2, ArchRFC with PHI or cryptographic scope.
- **Judge of last resort / final Reflexion retry** — when a stage has exhausted its Reflexion budget and is still `revise`, the driver may escalate to gpt-5.5 for the deciding verdict.

When `escalate: true`, the server selects `gpt-5.5` (pinned in `DEFAULT_MODELS.codex_critique_escalated`). The default **remains `gpt-5.4` per JUDGE-1** for all ordinary gates. Arbitrary caller-passed `model` strings are still ignored — escalation is a boolean selecting between two PINNED allow-listed models, never a free-form string.

## What the driver actually does

1. Call `gate_eligible_judges(gate_type, generator_producer, generator_model?, prompt_keywords, profile, artifact_kind, rubric_hint?)`.
2. Read `required_cross_vendor`, `rubric_id`, and `allowed_judges`.
3. If `required_cross_vendor` and the generator was Codex → invoke `judge-cross-vendor` (which calls `pp_gemini.critique`). If the generator was Gemini → `judge-cross-vendor` calls `pp_codex.critique`.
4. If `required_cross_vendor` is false → invoke `judge-same-vendor` (which calls `pp_<same>.critique` with a different `model_id`, except for the documented degenerate Gemini lane).
5. `rubric_hint` is for stage-declared intent (for example a forum stage that already names `rfc-2119-normative@1` or `web-runtime-validation@2`). It does not bypass the daemon; it gives the daemon enough context to return the right `rubric_id`.
6. The judge fetches the rubric body via `get_rubric(rubric_id)` and applies it to score the artifact when `rubric_id` is non-null. If `rubric_id` is null, the judge falls back to its default critique rubric.
7. Verdict recorded via `record_verdict`. The daemon computes the `cross_vendor` flag from `judge_producer` vs `attempt.producer` and stores it.

## Reading the verdict

A pass requires every rubric dimension ≥ 0.7 (per the rubric's own scoring envelope; see `rubric-application.md`). If any dimension is below the rubric's minimum (some rubrics enforce ≥ 0.5 for specific dimensions), the judge MUST emit `outcome: "fail"`, not `revise`. `revise` is for the soft band where Reflexion is most likely to help.
